# Sales_analysis

In this project, we are analysing monthly sales data, for an year, of a store, selling electronic products in multiple cities across United States.
We are answering following questions:

1. What was the best month for Sales and how much was revenue in that month?
2. Which city sold the most products?
3. What time should we display advertisements to maximize the likelihood of purchases?
4. What products are most often sold together?
5. What product sold the most? Why do you think it did?

Objective: The objective of this project is to analyze monthly sales data to identify trends and patterns in sales and draw conclusions as to why sales decreased or increased in particular months.
Data sources: The data is obtained from the store's point of sale (POS) system.

Methodology: The data is cleaned and preprocessed to remove any irrelevant or missing data. Exploratory data analysis is performed to identify trends and patterns in sales. Time series analysis is used to model the relationship between sales and time. Factors such as seasonality, promotions, and external factors are considered in the analysis.

Results: The analysis showed that sales were highest during the holiday season and lowest during the summer months. The results were presented through visualizations such as line charts and heatmaps.

Contributions: I was responsible for data cleaning and preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, time series analysis, and visualizations.

Impact: The insights from this analysis were used by the store to optimize inventory management, plan promotions, and improve sales during off-peak months.
