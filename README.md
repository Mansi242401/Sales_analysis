# Sales_analysis

In this project, we are analysing monthly sales data of a store selling electronic products in multiple cities across United States.
We are answering following questions:

1. What was the best month for Sales and how much was revenue in that month?
2. Which city sold the most products?
3. What time should we display advertisements to maximize the likelihood of purchases?
4. What products are most often sold together?
5. What product sold the most? Why do you think it did?
